Programms for the diploma.
errors_v6.py is the final wersion of the program. It searches for specific mistakes and then creates an annotation file
with tags and correct answers.
In order to this program to work, it is necessary to have text files and a py file in one folder. For each text you should
restart a program and change the name of the text in a py file.
For example, file_in = u'test.txt' means that 'test.txt' will be tested.
